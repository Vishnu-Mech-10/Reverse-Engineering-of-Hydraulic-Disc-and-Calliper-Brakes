# Reverse-Engineering-of-Hydraulic-Disc-and-Calliper-Brakes
Reverse engineering hydraulic disc and calliper brakes involves analysing existing components  through disassembly, 3D scanning, and CAD-Modelling to understand their design, then digitally recreating and potentially optimizing them for improved performance, weight reduction, cost- effectiveness, or to create efficient heat flow rate.
